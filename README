Abc-Menu installs some more menu-Items for easier access and 
remembering.

vim is a very powerfull editor with tons of functions and even 
more documentation. I always found new functions and i was looking
for a way to search them quickly. index.txt was my friend so far :)

Sometime I have my little daughter laying in my arm and I have only 
one hand for writing. In this case, some functions of vim are very hard
to reach.

This file helps me in both cases.
I made an alphabetical menu for some of the functions for the normal mode.
The reason for strict alphabetical order  is to make using the menu
like typing the commands and help to remember to type the command next time 
or to be able to use another vim on another maching without this special menu.

There are some special sub-menus
 i = shift
 k = control
 l = alt
I think ijkl are keys that everyone knows. You won't find them in the Abc-Menu.

Example for using the menu:
If you want to reach all commands in Normal mode with Uppercase characters
type following keys:
  alt      invoke menu  (or alt-n together)
    n      normal-Mode commands
     i    shift-commands 

Look at the bottom of the screen. Every command has a little tip. I took most
tips from index.txt.

tested with gvim 6.2, windows XP
Knoppix 3.7: the tips are missing,  Hotkey only in left textarea possible
